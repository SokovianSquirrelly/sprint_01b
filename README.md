# Overview

This program was written while I was learning to code in Dart language.  I had written this program to learn how to implement mathmatical expressions into Dart code.  This program acts as a calculator for different geometric shapes.  For example, I can ask it to find the circumference of a circle, the area of a trapezoid, the hypotenuse of a right triangle, etc.  This program was also meant to help me learn some aspects of the 'dart:math' library.

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Language: Dart with 'dart:io' and 'dart:math' libraries

Version Control System: Git

# Useful Websites

* [I used this site for general tutorials for Dart language.](https://dart.dev/tutorials)
* [This site was really helpful in teaching me how the 'Dart:math' library works.](https://api.dart.dev/stable/1.10.1/dart-math/dart-math-library.html)

# Future Work

* Implementing error-checking and exception handling when someone enters a string in input meant for numbers.
* Cleaning my functions up and putting them into shape classes.
* Make my program able to handle more calculations.
